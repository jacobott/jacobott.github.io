<p>To start off, I was born in LA California. At the age of two years old my family moved to Santa Rosa, California just about an hour drive north of San Francisco. While in Santa Rosa I grew up doing many activites such as rock climbing, mountain biking, and kayaking. Growing up, my family was very active in outdoor sports and eating health. </p>
    
<p>As I grew older and graduated from high school, I left Santa Rosa to attend my first year of college at BYU-Idaho. BYU-Idaho is located in Rexburg, Idaho just about an hour south east of Yellowstone National Park. While at school I struggles to find a degree I was passionate about. I started with Exercise Physiology, then to Business Management. After a year of school I submitted my mission papers and soon thereafter left to serve in Columbus, Ohio. While there I learn many life lessons that I will never forget. After returning home I still began to stuggle to find a career path that seemed right for me. I flipped and flopped from Communications to Business Management, then finally buckled down with Web Design and Development. I have a found a passion for the digital arts and web creation. My dream career is to become a UX designer.</p>
